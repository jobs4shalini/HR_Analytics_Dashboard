# HR Analytics-Pivot Table + Pivot chart_Filter_Slicer 
In this file the data is complex, and I was supposed to reflect different combinations of data series through this information. In such case instead of plotting many different charts, I created Pivot Table and one Pivot chart using different FILTERS and SLICER to get whole information through this one chart itself.
